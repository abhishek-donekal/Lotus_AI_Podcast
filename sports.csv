0,Truong My Lan: Vietnamese billionaire accused in multi-billion dollar bank fraud,"Truong My Lan started life as a market trader. Now, she is accused of stealing billions.","It was the most spectacular trial ever held in Vietnam, befitting one of the greatest bank frauds the world has ever seen.  Behind the stately yellow portico of the colonial-era courthouse in Ho Chi Minh City, a 67-year-old Vietnamese property developer was sentenced to death on Thursday for looting one of the country's largest banks over a period of 11 years.  It's a rare verdict - she is one of very few women in Vietnam to be sentenced to death for a white collar crime.  The decision is a reflection of the dizzying scale of the fraud. Truong My Lan was convicted of taking out $44bn (Â£35bn) in loans from the Saigon Commercial Bank. The verdict requires her to return $27bn, a sum prosecutors said may never be recovered. Some believe the death penalty is the court's way of trying to encourage her to return some of the missing billions.  The habitually secretive communist authorities were uncharacteristically forthright about this case, going into minute detail for the media. They said 2,700 people were summoned to testify, while 10 state prosecutors and around 200 lawyers were involved.  The evidence was in 104 boxes weighing a total of six tonnes. Eighty-five others were tried with Truong My Lan, who denied the charges and can appeal.  All of the defendants were found guilty. Four received life in jail. The rest were given prison terms ranging from 20 years to three years suspended. Truong My Lan's husband and niece received jail terms of nine and 17 years respectively. ""There has never been a show trial like this, I think, in the communist era,"" says David Brown, a retired US state department official with long experience in Vietnam. ""There has certainly been nothing on this scale."" The trial was the most dramatic chapter so far in the ""Blazing Furnaces"" anti-corruption campaign led by the Communist Party Secretary-General, Nguyen Phu Trong.  A conservative ideologue steeped in Marxist theory, Nguyen Phu Trong believes that popular anger over untamed corruption poses an existential threat to the Communist Party's monopoly on power. He began the campaign in earnest in 2016 after out-manoeuvring the then pro-business prime minister to retain the top job in the party.  The campaign has seen two presidents and two deputy prime ministers forced to resign, and hundreds of officials disciplined or jailed. Now one of the country's richest women has joined their ranks.   Truong My Lan comes from a Sino-Vietnamese family in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. It has long been the commercial engine of the Vietnamese economy, dating well back to its days as the anti-communist capital of South Vietnam, with a large, ethnic Chinese community.  She started as a market stall vendor, selling cosmetics with her mother, but began buying land and property after the Communist Party ushered in a period of economic reform, known as Doi Moi, in 1986. By the 1990s, she owned a large portfolio of hotels and restaurants. Although Vietnam is best known outside the country for its fast-growing manufacturing sector, as an alternative supply chain to China, most wealthy Vietnamese made their money developing and speculating in property.  All land is officially state-owned. Getting access to it often relies on personal relationships with state officials. Corruption escalated as the economy grew, and became endemic.  By 2011, Truong My Lan was a well-known business figure in Ho Chi Minh City, and she was allowed to arrange the merger of three smaller, cash-strapped banks into a larger entity: Saigon Commercial Bank.  Vietnamese law prohibits any individual from holding more than 5% of the shares in any bank. But prosecutors say that through hundreds of shell companies and people acting as her proxies, Truong My Lan actually owned more than 90% of Saigon Commercial.  They accused her of using that power to appoint her own people as managers, and then ordering them to approve hundreds of loans to the network of shell companies she controlled. The amounts taken out are staggering. Her loans made up 93% of all the bank's lending.  According to prosecutors, over a period of three years from February 2019, she ordered her driver to withdraw 108 trillion Vietnamese dong, more than $4bn (Â£2.3bn) in cash from the bank, and store it in her basement.  That much cash, even if all of it was in Vietnam's largest denomination banknotes, would weigh two tonnes.  She was also accused of bribing generously to ensure her loans were never scrutinised. A former chief inspector at the central bank was given a life sentence for accepting a $5m bribe. The mass of officially sanctioned publicity about the case channelled public anger over corruption against Truong My Lan, whose fatigued, unmade-up appearance in court was in stark contrast to the glamorous publicity photos people had seen of her in the past.  But questions are also being asked about why she was able to keep on with the alleged fraud for so long. ""I am puzzled,"" says Le Hong Hiep who runs the Vietnam Studies Programme at the ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.  ""Because it wasn't a secret. It was well known in the market that Truong My Lan and her Van Thinh Phat group were using SCB as their own piggy bank to fund the mass acquisition of real estate in the most prime locations.  ""It was obvious that she had to get the money from somewhere. But then it is such a common practice. SCB is not the only bank that is used like this. So perhaps the government lost sight because there are so many similar cases in the market."" David Brown believes she was protected by powerful figures who have dominated business and politics in Ho Chi Minh City for decades. And he sees a bigger factor in play in the way this trial is being run: a bid to reassert the authority of the Communist Party over the free-wheeling business culture of the south. ""What Nguyen Phu Trong and his allies in the party are trying to do is to regain control of Saigon, or at least stop it from slipping away.  ""Up until 2016 the party in Hanoi pretty much let this Sino-Vietnamese mafia run the place. They would make all the right noises that local communist leaders are supposed to make, but at the same time they were milking the city for a substantial cut of the money that was being made down there."" At 79 years old, party chief Nguyen Phu Trong is in shaky health, and will almost certainly have to retire at the next Communist Party Congress in 2026, when new leaders will be chosen.  He has been one of the longest-serving and most consequential secretary-generals, restoring the authority of the party's conservative wing to a level not seen since the reforms of the 1980s. He clearly does not want to risk permitting enough openness to undermine the party's hold on political power.  But he is trapped in a contradiction. Under his leadership the party has set an ambitious goal of reaching rich country status by 2045, with a technology and knowledge-based economy. This is what is driving the ever-closer partnership with the United States.  Yet faster growth in Vietnam almost inevitably means more corruption. Fight corruption too much, and you risk extinguishing a lot of economic activity. Already there are complaints that bureaucracy has slowed down, as officials shy away from decisions which might implicate them in a corruption case. ""That's the paradox,"" says Le Hong Hiep. ""Their growth model has been reliant on corrupt practices for so long. Corruption has been the grease that kept the machinery working. If they stop the grease, things may not work any more.""

1,Israel-Gaza war: Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh says three sons killed in air strike,Israel says Ismail Haniyeh's sons were all members of Hamas's military wing.,"Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh has confirmed that three of his sons and four of his grandchildren were killed in an air strike in Gaza.  Hamas-linked media said the car his sons were travelling in was hit in Al-Shati camp near Gaza City. Haniyeh said that the incident would not change Hamas's demands in talks aimed at reaching a ceasefire deal. Israel's military said the sons were members of Hamas's military wing - a claim denied by Haniyeh. The group was reportedly on its way to a family celebration to mark the first day of the Muslim holiday of Eid.  Haniyeh told the broadcaster Al Jazeera that three sons - Hazem, Amir, and Muhammad - had remained in Gaza during the war. A statement from Hamas later said four of Haniyeh's grandchildren - Mona, Amal, Khaled and Razan - were among those killed in what they called the ""treacherous and cowardly"" strike. Haniyeh said he heard the news as he was visiting wounded Palestinians who had been taken for treatment to the Qatari capital, Doha, which is where the Hamas leader lives. ""The enemy will be delusional if it thinks that targeting my sons, at the climax of the [ceasefire] negotiations and before the movement sends its response, will push Hamas to change its position,"" he told Al Jazeera. In comments reported on Hamas's Telegram channel, he thanked God for the ""honour"" bestowed on him by what he called the ""martyrdom of his children and grandchildren"".  Israel's military said it had ""eliminated three Hamas military wing operatives in the central Gaza Strip"", adding that they were the sons of Ismail Haniyeh. The statement did not mention the reported deaths of Haniyeh's grandchildren.  Speaking to Reuters on Thursday, Haniyeh denied that his sons were Hamas fighters.  As international pressure to reach a ceasefire deal grows, US President Joe Biden has sent the head of the CIA, William Burns, for the latest round of talks in Cairo. The latest proposal, which Hamas says it is analysing, reportedly includes the release of 40 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza in return for 900 Palestinians from Israeli jails.  Haniyeh is widely considered Hamas's overall leader and has been a prominent member of the movement since 1980. He was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017 and the US Department of State designated him a terrorist in 2018. These are not the first members of Haniyeh's family to have been killed in the war. Another son was reportedly killed in February, while his brother and nephew were killed in October, followed by a grandson in November. Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage. Israel says that of 130 hostages still in Gaza, at least 34 are dead. More than 33,000 Gazans, the majority of them civilians, have been killed during Israel's offensive in Gaza since the October attack, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Can US pressure deliver Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza? Who are the leaders of Hamas?"
2,Apple sparks Palestinian flag emoji controversy,"iPhone users noticed a Palestinian flag emoji is being suggested when users type ""Jerusalem.""","Apple has been criticised after the Palestinian flag emoji was automatically suggested to iPhone users who type ""Jerusalem."" Both Israel and the Palestinians hold competing claims to the ancient city.  TV presenter Rachel Riley, who is Jewish, noted on social media that national flags were not suggested for other capitals. Apple has told the BBC that the change - which followed a recent software update - was not intentional. The issue will be remedied in a future software update, Apple says, but it is not known how rapidly this will happen. Writing on X (formerly Twitter), Ms Riley demanded that Apple explain what had happened. ""Showing double standards with respect to Israel is a form of antisemitism"", she argued. The issue, according to Apple, relates to a feature called predictive emoji. iPhones can suggest emojis when words are typed in messages, and other apps.  The notes accompanying the latest iOS update say that it includes ""new emojis."" The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest disputes in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel sees the whole of Jerusalem as its eternal, undivided capital, while Palestinians claim the eastern part as the capital of their hoped-for future state. East Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, were captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in a war in 1967, and have since been viewed internationally as occupied Palestinian territory. This is not the first time a big tech company has found itself embroiled in the bitter dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.  Last year rival tech giant Meta had to apologise after a bug resulted in it adding ""terrorist"" to the biographies of some Instagram users describing themselves as Palestinian. Meta said it fixed a problem ""that briefly caused inappropriate Arabic translations"" in some of its products. Meta sorry for Palestinian 'terrorist' bio error"
3,Donald Trump says Arizona's 1864 abortion ban goes too far,The presumptive Republican presidential nominee also said he would not sign a federal abortion ban.,"This video can not be played Watch: Shouts of ""shame"" as Arizona lawmakers spar over abortion ban Arizona's legislature descended into cries of ""shame!"" as senior Republicans blocked attempts to repeal the state's 1864 law banning abortion. Republican majority leaders on Wednesday cut off two attempts to discuss a repeal and adjourned for the week, prompting chants from Democrats. One Republican described it as ""extremist, insurrectionist"" behaviour. The state's top court on Tuesday ruled the law was enforceable, but put the ruling on hold for at least 14 days. The disagreements among state lawmakers follow a wave of protests about the Arizona supreme court's decision, which has potentially sweeping implications for women's healthcare and election-year politics in a battleground state.  The ruling was criticised by both Donald Trump and the White House. Governor Katie Hobbs called for a repeal and Attorney General Kris Mayes, a fellow Democrat, has said she would not prosecute those performing or obtaining abortions.  However, Republicans in the legislature on Wednesday said there was no reason to rush the debate. The party's chief whip, Teresa Martinez, said the House was ""navigating an extremely complex, emotional and important area of law and policy"". She accused Democrats of ""screaming at us and engaging in extremist and insurrectionist behaviour on the House floor"", and said ""pregnancy... should be celebrated. It is an abortion that terminates life."" The 1864 law criminalises abortion except to save a mother's life. There is no provision for victims of rape or incest. A 14-day moratorium on the court's ruling is in place while a lower court considers added arguments about the law's constitutionality. Hobbs called the inaction unconscionable. ""Radical legislators protected a Civil War-era total abortion ban that jails doctors, strips women of our bodily autonomy and puts our lives at risk,"" she said. The row in the legislature came hours after Mr Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, said Arizona's supreme court ruling had gone too far but he believed it would quickly be ""straightened out"".  In the video statement posted on his social media platform Truth Social, Mr Trump also took credit for the US Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v Wade, the landmark decision that protected abortion access across the US for nearly 50 years.  An Arizona clinic told CBS, the BBC's partner in the US, that it intended to stay open until the last moment before the court ruling is confirmed. Ashleigh Feiring, a registered nurse at Camelback Family Planning in Phoenix, said abortion services were still available and that staff hopes emergency legislation would stop the law's enforcement. Dr Gabrielle Goodrick, Camelback's founder, told the BBC the possible ban was ""draconian"". ""My reaction has been shock, dismay, disgust,"" she said. ""This law is going back in time when people didn't have bodily autonomy.""  Anti-abortion groups including SBA Pro-Life America meanwhile urged Arizona residents to oppose a proposed ballot initiative aimed at placing abortion rights in Arizona's state constitution. ""They would wipe away all pro-life laws put in place by the Legislature, reflective of the will of the people,"" SBA President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement. She said the 1964 law was an ""enormous victory for unborn children and their mothers"". If it is enforced, Arizona residents seeking an abortion would have to travel to a neighbouring state where the procedure is still legal, such as California, New Mexico or Nevada.   19th Century law fires up anti-abortion push Let states decide abortion rights, Trump says Trump backlash spotlights an abortion balancing act"
4,Ukraine war: The Indian men traumatised by fighting for Russia,Two men who were duped by agents into joining the war against Ukraine speak about their experiences.,"In October last year, David Moothappan saw a Facebook advertisement offering jobs as security guards in Russia. The promised monthly salary - 204,000 roubles ($2,201; Â£1,739) - seemed a huge amount to the school-dropout fisherman from the southern Indian state of Kerala. Weeks later, Mr Moothappan, 23, found himself on the warfront in the Russian-held city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine.  ""It's death and destruction everywhere,"" he says, when asked about his time there. He and another man from Kerala managed to return home last week. They are among several Indians who were duped by agents into fighting for Russian forces in the country's war with Ukraine over the past few months. A few have managed to make their way back home but others are still stuck in Russia. Most of them are from poor families and were lured with the promise of jobs, sometimes as ""helpers"" in the Russian army. At least two Indians have died so far in the war. India's foreign ministry has said it is ""pressing very hard with the Russian authorities"" to bring back its citizens who have been tricked into fighting in the war. Last week, foreign minister S Jaishankar called this ""a matter of very, very deep concern"" for India. The BBC has emailed the Russian embassy in India for comment. Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing. Mr Moothappan is relieved to be back home in the fishing village of Pozhiyoor in Kerala, but says he can't forget what he saw in the war. ""There were body parts strewn all over the ground,"" he says. Distraught, he started vomiting and almost fainted. ""Soon, the Russian officer commanding us told me to return to the camp. It took hours for me to recover,"" he says. He says he broke his leg around Christmas while fighting in a ""remote place"" - his family, he says, didn't know about his situation at that time. Mr Moothappan spent two and a half months in different hospitals in Luhansk, Volgograd and Rostov before recovering partially.  In March, a group of Indians helped him reach the country's embassy in Moscow, which then arranged for him to travel back home.  Some 61km away in Anchuthengu, another fishing hamlet in Kerala, Prince Sebastian has a similar story of escape - and trauma - to tell.  Duped by a local agent, he was deployed in a group of 30 fighters in the Russian-occupied eastern Ukrainian town of Lysychansk. After just three weeks of training, he says he was sent to the frontline with several weapons including an RPG-30 (a handheld, disposable rocket-propelled grenade launcher) and bombs, which prevented him from moving quickly. Fifteen minutes after he reached the front, he says a bullet fired from close range deflected off the tank he was in and pierced below his left ear. He fell - on to what he realised was a dead Russian soldier.   ""I was shocked and I couldn't move. After an hour, as the night fell, another bomb exploded. It badly injured my left leg."" He spent the night in a trench, bleeding. He escaped the next morning and subsequently spent weeks in different hospitals. He then got a month's leave to rest. During this time, a priest helped him contact the Indian embassy which then issued him a temporary passport and arranged for his return home.  He says two of his friends who went with him, also fishermen, are still missing. Neither he nor their families have heard from them in weeks. Officials in Kerala say they have so far received complaints from the families of four men - Mr Moothappan, Mr Sebastian and his two friends - about being duped by agents.  Mr Sebastian says he and his friends went to a local agent in their village to check if they could find jobs somewhere in Europe (the man is currently absconding).  The agent suggested Russia, speaking of a ""golden opportunity"" to work as a security guard for a monthly salary of 200,000 rupees ($2,402; Â£1,898). They agreed instantly. The friends paid 700,000 rupees each to him for a Russian visa. On 4 January, they reached Moscow, where an Indian agent identified as Alex, who spoke their language, Malayalam, welcomed them.  They spent the night in a flat, following which a man took them to a military officer in the city of Kostroma, 336km (208 miles) away, where they were made to sign a contract in Russian, a language they couldn't read, Mr Sebastian said.  Three Sri Lankan recruits also joined them there. Then the six men were taken to a military camp in the Rostov region, which borders Ukraine. The officers took their passports and mobile phones.  The training started on 10 January. In the following days, they learnt how to use handheld anti-tank grenades and what to do if they were injured. After this, they were taken to a secondary base known as the Alabino Polygon. There, the training continued for 10 days, ""day and night"". ""All kinds of armaments were waiting for us there,"" Mr Sebastian said. ""I started enjoying the weapons like toys."" But the brutal reality of the war hit him on the battlefield.  Now, he is hoping to resume fishing. ""I have to repay the money I borrowed from lenders and restart my life,"" he says.  In Pozhiyoor, Mr Moothappan hopes to do the same.  ""I was engaged to a girl in my village when I left. I told her I'll return with money and build a house before our marriage,"" he said.  Now the couple have decided to wait for two more years as Mr Moothappan tries to rebuild his life. But he's happy that at least he didn't kill anyone in his time on the battlefield.  ""One time, the Ukrainians were some 200m away. We were asked to go on the offensive but I didn't fire a single shot at them,"" he said. ""I can't kill anybody."""
5,Allen Weisselberg: Ex-Trump financial chief sentenced on perjury charges,"Allen Weisselberg, 76, pleaded guilty to lying under oath during Donald Trump's civil fraud trial.","A judge in New York has sentenced the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization to five months in prison on two counts of perjury. Allen Weisselberg, 76, pleaded guilty to the charges last month, admitting he had lied under oath three times during the company's recent civil fraud trial. Unflinching in his loyalty to the Trump family, the Florida retiree now faces his second stint behind bars. He served 100 days last year on tax fraud charges involving the company. On Wednesday morning, he spoke only once - to tell Justice Laurie Peterson he had nothing to say - before she imposed his sentence and he was led out of court in handcuffs. The two felony counts against him relate to false sworn testimony the executive gave in two separate deposition, as well as in trial testimony, regarding the size of former President Donald Trump's triplex apartment in New York. Attorneys prosecuting the case argued the company had - with Mr Weisselberg's explicit knowledge - overvalued the penthouse in financial statements at roughly three times its actual size. Under oath, Mr Weisselberg claimed he had learned about the false valuation from a Forbes report, but prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney's office said he has since admitted he knew about it long before then. The civil case ended with the former president ordered to pay more than $450m, including interest, and Mr Weisselberg ordered to pay $1m. Both men have appealed the ruling, and Mr Trump has since posted a $175m bond in response to the judgment. Mr Weisselberg, who began working for the Trumps in the early 1970s, retired in 2021 after being hit with the earlier tax charges. The Trump Organization provided him a $2m (Â£1.6m) severance package and continues to pay his legal bills. He pleaded guilty in 2022 to helping facilitate a 15-year scheme by which he and other company executives evaded taxes on company perks, such as a rent-free luxury apartment in Manhattan, tuition for his grand children and two Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Although his plea agreement resulted in a five-month sentence at New York's notorious Rikers Island complex, he was released on good behaviour after serving 100 days. As he now returns to Rikers, he will again be eligible for release in 100 days. Prosecutors have agreed not to call Mr Weisselberg as a witness in Mr Trump's criminal trial beginning Monday over hush money payments to a porn star before the 2016 election. Mr Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing. But Mr Weisselberg's alleged role in helping falsify company records to cover up those payments is expected to nevertheless factor into the trial.

6,Biden 'considering' request to drop Assange charges,Australia wants the US president to end attempts to extradite the Wikileaks founder from the UK.,"US President Joe Biden has said he is considering a request from Australia to drop the prosecution of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The country's parliament recently passed a measure - backed by PM Anthony Albanese - calling for the return of Mr Assange to his native Australia.  The US wants to extradite the 52-year-old from the UK on criminal charges over the leaking of military records. Mr Assange denies the charges, saying the leaks were an act of journalism. The president was asked about Australia's request on Wednesday and said: ""We're considering it."" Mr Albanese said Mr Biden's comments were ""encouraging"" and he was ""increasingly optimistic about an outcome"". ""We want Mr Assange to be able to return home,"" he told Sky News Australia. The Australian measure passed parliament in February. At the time, Mr Albanese told MPs: ""People will have a range of views about Mr Assange's conduct... But regardless of where people stand, this thing cannot just go on and on and on indefinitely."" Mr Assange, 52, is fighting extradition in the UK courts.  The extradition was put on hold in March after London's High Court said the United States must provide assurances he would not face the death penalty. The High Court is due to evaluate any responses from the US authorities at the end of May.  Mr Assange's wife Stella said she was also encouraged by Mr Biden's comments. ""It looks like things could be moving in the right direction,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that she believed the president should have dropped the case against her husband on the first day of his premiership.  ""Lots of people around the world... have been saying for years that this case should be dropped, that it is a danger to press freedom."" When asked about her husband's health, Stella Assange said he was ""extremely unwell"". ""He's stressed, obviously, because he could be extradited to the US to face 175 years in prison."" Kristinn Hrafnsson, the current editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, said that it was ""not too late"" for the American president to stop the extradition attempt, which he said was a ""politically motivated act"" by Mr Biden's predecessor. US prosecutors want to try the Wikileaks founder on 18 counts, almost all under the Espionage Act, over the release of confidential US military records and diplomatic messages relating to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr Assange founded the Wikileaks website in 2006. It claims to have published more than ten million documents, including many confidential or restricted official reports related to war, spying and corruption. In 2010, it released a video from a US military helicopter which showed civilians being killed in the Iraqi capital Baghdad.  It also published thousands of confidential documents supplied by former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.  These suggested that the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents during the war in Afghanistan. Manning leaked the files to Wikileaks in 2010. She was later jailed for 35 years, but former President Barack Obama commuted her sentence in 2017. The US Department of Justice called the leaks ""one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States"". Mr Assange has been in Belmarsh prison in London for the past five years pending a number of legal challenges.  Before that he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy for seven years. He initially faced a Swedish arrest warrant accusing him of having raped one woman and sexually assaulted another. He denied the claims.  In 2019 the Swedish authorities dropped the case, after he had been indicted on the US charges, saying too much time had passed since the original complaint.

7,Multiple people shot outside Ramadan celebration in Philadelphia,"The shots were fired following an argument, outside a mosque observing the end of Ramadan.","This video can not be played Watch: 'Very fortunate' no one died in shooting - police At least two people were shot near an event celebrating the end of Ramadan in Philadelphia, police said. Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel said five people were arrested after ""young people actively engaged in gunfire"" close to the Eid al-Fitr celebration. No one was killed in the shooting, the commissioner emphasised. He said that the shooting occurred between ""two factions"" at the outdoor event where 1,000 people were present.  An adult was hit in the exchange of gunfire, the police official said, and a 15-year-old suspect was shot in the leg and shoulder by police.  The teenaged gunman is in stable condition and was taken to hospital, said Mr Bethel.  He also noted that a third person appeared at a nearby hospital with a gunshot wound to his hand, though it was not immediately clear whether the person was involved in the gun battle.  Authorities have recovered five weapons that they suspect were involved in the shooting. One child pedestrian was hit by a police vehicle while fleeing the scene and suffered a broken leg, Mr Bethel said. ""Ninety-nine percent of the individuals at this event are good people who wanted to have a good time,"" the commissioner said. And once again, we have young people engaging in gunfire who just really destroyed the sanctity of the event."" Helicopter footage from the Clara Muhammad Square park shows a large crime scene outside the Philadelphia Masjid mosque. The video shows the food trucks and tents brought in for the celebration. Witnesses described a chaotic scene during an event that was supposed to memorialise the holy day, with families separated from their loved ones as the crowd fled the scene. Abdallah Legh, an employee at the Girard Meat Market near the crime scene, told Fox's local affiliate WTXF-TV that between 20 to 30 children came rushing into his store seeking shelter soon after he heard the crack of gunfire.  The FBI and Pennsylvania State Police are assisting Philadelphia police in the investigation, according to CBS. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro posted on X, formerly Twitter: ""Eid should always be a time of joy for our Muslim neighbors â and I grieve for every member of the Philadelphia Muslim community whose celebration was shattered by gun violence today."""
8,One dead as severe storms hit the US Gulf Coast,"A weather front brought flooding and tornadoes to New Orleans, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas.","This video can not be played Watch: Floods and tornadoes cause damage in US Gulf states A severe weather system has caused widespread flooding and tornadoes, bringing storm damage to the US South. Large areas across the states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were affected, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).  The system has moved east, with parts of Florida and Georgia now covered by storm and flash-flood warnings. One death was earlier reported in Scott County, Mississippi, about 200 miles (320km) north of New Orleans.  The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency did not give further details about Tuesday's incident or the cause of death. A second person was injured. Amid severe conditions on Wednesday, tracking site PowerOutage.us showed a peak of more than 200,000 customers across the region without power - a number that reduced over time.  Flash flooding was reported in the New Orleans area, where more than a month's worth of rain was recorded over just a few hours, and several suspected tornadoes caused damage across the Gulf Coast region. Police in Slidell, Louisiana, said at least 10 people were injured and taken to hospital for treatment following a possible tornado.  Officers also said they had rescued about 50 people in the city, as another local official described ""catastrophic"" damage. Another confirmed twister hit the town of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Homes were damaged but there were no reports of injuries. The storm front moved eastward throughout the day and parts of southeast Alabama, Florida and Georgia spent the evening under tornado warnings. By Thursday morning, NWS flash-flood warnings were in place in multiple parts of Florida. Earlier, the same storm front brought severe weather to Texas, with another suspected tornado touching down outside of Houston overnight on Tuesday. In south-eastern Texas, floods caused evacuations and closed highways, and rescue operations are ongoing, according to CBS News and local reports.  By Thursday morning, the NWS had a number of flash-flood warnings covering more easterly areas, including multiple parts of Florida.   Sport has also been impacted, with the start of the golf Masters delayed because of thunderstorms at Augusta National in Georgia. The opening tee shots were due to be struck at 08:00 local time (13:00 BST), but ""heavy rainfall and wind gusts of 40-45mph"" prompted a postponement ""until further notice""."
9,Idaho man Chad Daybell on trial for 'doomsday plot' killings,Prosecutors claim Chad Daybell and his wife thought her two children were 'dark spirits'.,"Sex, money and ""power"" led an Idaho man to murder his first wife and two of his second wife's children in a ""doomsday plot"", prosecutors have alleged.  Chad Daybell is accused of killing ex-wife Tammy Daybell, as well as Joshua ""JJ"" Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 16. The children's mother, Lori Vallow Daybell, was sentenced to life in prison for their murders last year.  Mr Daybell, 55, faces the death penalty if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty.  At the start of Mr Daybell's trial on Wednesday, prosecutors said that he and Ms Vallow believed her children were ""dark spirits"" and ""zombies"" and murdered them in 2019, approximately a year after the pair met at a religious event.   Prosecutors claimed the two were having an affair together and came to view Mrs Daybell as a potential obstacle.  ""When he had a chance at what he considered his rightful destiny, he made sure that no person, no law would stand in his way,"" prosecutor Rob Wood said.  ""His desire for sex, money and power led him to pursue those ambitions and this pursuit led to the deaths of his wife and Lori's two innocent children."" After a long search, the remains of the children were found buried on Mr Daybell's property in June 2020.  One of the children had been dismembered and burned, while the other was bound.  Mrs Daybell died of asphyxiation in October 2019, 17 days before Mr Daybell married Ms Vallow at a ceremony in Hawaii.  Mr Wood said that jurors will be shown ""extended text messages to reveal his mindset and his motivations"".  The attorney defending Mr Daybell, John Prior, said expert witnesses would testify that his client's DNA was never found on the children's remains.  Instead, he sought to shift blame to Ms Vallow's brother, Alex Cox, who died in 2019. At the time of his death, police were investigating an incident in which Mr Cox shot dead his sister's fourth husband, Charles Vallow.  ""Whenever there was a problem or threat, you will hear testimony that Alex Cox came to the rescue,"" Mr Prior said, adding that Mr Cox's DNA was found on a piece of plastic alongside one of the children's remains.  Additionally, Mr Prior claimed there was no evidence to suggest that Mrs Daybell's death was the result of foul play.  Mr Daybell has also been charged with conspiracy to commit murder and faces insurance fraud charges stemming from life insurance policies he had taken out. The judge in the case, Steve Boyce, sentenced Ms Vallow to three consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole in July 2023.  The trial is expected to last approximately nine weeks.
