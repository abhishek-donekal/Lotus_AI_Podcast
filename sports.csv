0,Everton issue 'makes mockery of Premier League',"The manner in which financial-rule breaches are dealt with ""makes a mockery of the Premier League"", says Luton midfielder Andros Townsend."," Last updated on 8 April 20248 April 2024.From the section Everton The uncertainty around how financial rule breaches are handled ""makes a mockery of the Premier League"", says Luton Town midfielder Andros Townsend. Everton were docked two points for a second violation of the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR) on Monday. They say they will appeal against the decision but the process may not be completed before the season ends. That could leave clubs uncertain of their top-flight status after 19 May. PSR rules permit clubs to lose £105m over three years and Everton were found to have breached that by £16.6m for the three-year period to 2022-23. The points deduction has dropped Everton one place to 16th in the Premier League, two points above the relegation zone. The Toffees also had a 10-point deduction reduced to six on appeal in February for the three-year period to 2021-22 while Nottingham Forest were deducted four points for PSR breaches in March and are awaiting the outcome of an appeal. Luton sit just inside the drop zone - separated from 17th-placed Forest on goal difference - and Townsend says his club still look at the league as though no points have been deducted because of the uncertainty surrounding hearings and appeals processes. ""We don't know what's going to happen with appeals,"" the former Everton player told BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club. ""We were probably celebrating when Everton got 10 points taken off them and then they got four given back and we're back in the relegation zone. So we take out the deductions to take away the confusion and we'll see at the end of the season."" Townsend said that he does not advocate for teams receiving points deductions and that the way in which they are handed out ""doesn't make sense"". He added: ""I think it makes a mockery of the Premier League. When you announce the charge, you have to be certain of the points deduction."" The 2023-24 season technically remains 'live' until the annual general meeting in June when relegated clubs transfer their certificates and 24 May has been selected as a 'backstop date' for the appeals process to be concluded. Townsend said he thinks clubs had not anticipated that punishments for breaching the rules would be ""this severe"". ""Everton would have known they weren't going to be inside that £105m debt mark because they spent £30m in the summer,"" he said. ""They spent that knowing they weren't going to make this £105m target. I think clubs just thought it would be a fine and a slap on the wrists and get on with it."" The Premier League had asked for a five-point deduction for Everton but an independent commission concluded that the fact Everton have already been punished this season ""for losses in years which overlap with the years at issue in these proceedings"" merited a two-point reduction in punishment. A further point was credited back for the loss of revenue after a sponsorship deal with Russian company USM was suspended, along with the early admission of guilt. Despite the uncertainty around when the appeal process might be complete, Everton fan and host of The Blue Room podcast Peter MacFarlane believes this latest deduction gives them - if not their relegation rivals - clarity. ""There has to be some sort of relief because it appears that it's coming to its conclusion now,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I feel like we've been in the dark since November - we haven't actually known where we stood in the league with these point deductions. ""As disappointing as it is to get more points taken off us and how much of an injustice we may feel that is, at least we now know what we need to do to stay in the Premier League."" Everton face games against relegation rivals Nottingham Forest, Sheffield United and Luton as well as the Merseyside derby on 24 April and a trip to Arsenal on the last day of the season. ""It's been difficult to keep morale high - or any resemblance of morale, to be honest. We just have to go out and win now and stay in the Premier League,"" MacFarlane said. ""It's been difficult to pick up points at home given the mood around the place but Evertonians have to come together, and I know that's what we do best when our backs are up against the wall."" Football finance expert Kieran Maguire on BBC Radio 5 Live The reduction in points from five to two is fair because Everton have already been punished for breaking the rules in 2021 and 2022 with respect to the first deduction.  I don't think the club are being treated harshly there and I don't think opposing clubs have been treated harshly.  There's a separate issue about why has it taken the Premier League so long to charge Everton with regards to the first set of offences. Why wasn't that held in the previous season (2022-23)? But that opens up a further can of worms.  The frightening thought is that we could reach the end of the season and we still don't know who's relegated. The Premier League wanted 10 points deducted from Everton the first time round, eight points from Forest and five points from Everton the second time round and you look at that and there is no consistency. Everton's deduction of six points for the three-year period to 2021-22 was for losses of £19.5m over the £105m permitted threshold while Nottingham Forest were deducted four points for breaching the permitted £61m threshold by £34.5m for the three-year period to 2022-23. The Toffees argued at the hearing that this is unfair and Forest had breached the threshold by significantly more - 56.6% in one reporting period - compared with their cumulative total of 34% (£36.1m) over the two reporting periods. The commission says that Forest's sanction was originally set at six points but two points were credited for ""early admission and exceptional cooperation"" with the process, which the Premier League said Everton did not do. The commission also added that the decision made in Everton's case is ""broadly consistent"" with the one made in the Forest case, saying Everton's punishment is ""justifiably higher"" because they had exceeded the threshold in two consecutive financial years. With that in mind, the commission says they ""do not regard"" Everton's second points deduction to be ""excessive, unfair to Everton or disproportionate"" in comparison with the Forest decision. Meanwhile, the Toffees said in a statement that the club is ""extremely concerned"" at the ""inconsistency"" of the punishments, with four different commissions issuing four different points deductions this season. Thomas Tuchel says Bayern Munich were denied a penalty by a ""kid's mistake"", while one pundit describes Arsenal not being awarded a spot-kick as ""quite alarming"".

1,Masters 2024: 'A sporting role like no other' - the role of a golf caddie,"The furthest inside the ropes, the closest to the stars - a caddie's role extends far beyond carrying bags and wiping clubs.","Mike Weir (left) and Brennan Little - friends since teenage years - conquered Augusta together in 2003 Sign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and read the latest in the series here. The sun was low in the sky and the shadows lengthening from the towering Augusta pine trees as Canadian Mike Weir approached his ball on the 10th fairway. Len Mattiace, his opponent in a sudden-death play-off, was in a spot of bother off the green. To all but secure the coveted Masters green jacket, Weir just had to hit the green with his approach shot. A life-changing victory rested on a couple of degrees of direction and a few pounds of pressure on the club face. The slightest waver in concentration, though, and it could be all over. The chance to land a first major may never come around again. The tension was huge. But some of the talk that had got him there was decidedly small. Caddie Brennan Little had lightened the mood around the Augusta National by chatting to Weir about the stars of WWE wrestling. Being a caddie is a lot more than carrying clubs - you are a confidant, coach, walking database, psychiatrist, the furthest inside the ropes and in the midst of the action. It is a sporting role like no other. Little grew up in southern Canada near Toronto with the dream of becoming a major champion himself. As a young prospect, he played with and against Weir before realising that he may need to go down a different route to his best friend to taste success at the highest level. ""I played some professional golf, but my career ended in 1998. I just wasn't playing very well and I wasn't getting any better,"" Little tells BBC Sport. ""Mike had gotten his tour card and I started as his caddie in 1999 thinking I would do it for a little bit. I have been caddying ever since. ""It is just kind of one of them things that happened. I just fell into it."" Like with all best friends, shared laughter is the sound of memories being made. For Little and Weir, it is no different. Both shared a love for family and sport, with Little often poking fun at Weir for his lack of knowledge on WWE. ""If you get on well and have things in common, whether it is sports or whatever, that is the key,"" Little says. ""If you don't have anything in common then you are going to be out there walking around trying to create conversation. ""Mike and I used to talk a lot about wrestling on the course. He was always a closet wrestling fan."" Weir shot 75 in the third round of the 2003 Masters to lose his four-shot lead, before recovering to take the title Weir went into his final round at Augusta two shots off the lead, but a superb 68 took him into a duel with American Mattiace for golf's biggest prize and a $1m winner's cheque. It was two mates having fun around the course that got Weir and Little into such uncharted territory. It was the same formula that saw them home to Butler Cabin. From that 10th fairway, Weir struck his approach shot and it landed on the back of the green - leaving a putt to win the Masters. ""They have been best friends since they were teens, playing junior golf and the Canadian tour together. He has worked with Mike since he came through the qualifying school. It is quite a partnership,"" said the television commentator as Weir lined up his putt. It certainly felt like a team effort to Little. ""It is a huge moment of personal satisfaction for everyone,"" Little says of a successful weekend on the bag. Tiger Woods, who won the 2002 Masters, presents Weir with his Green Jacket Little, who earned a weekly salary from the then 32-year-old Weir, also gained a share of all his winnings. It is a common arrangement, with percentages varying between pairings. A caddie might get a basic of $2,000 (Â£1,580) a week, with 7% of their player's winnings, jumping up to 10% for a finish near the top of the leaderboard. If a season goes well, a caddie might pick up a bonus. However, most caddies cover their own expenses, which, on a globe-trotting tour, can quickly rack up. When times are good and the million-dollar cheques get split, both parties are happy. But when times get tough and the money thins out, a golfer may feel that a hole in his pocket is the only thing their caddie is providing. All in all, even best friends can get fired. ""It is all part of the business,"" Little says. ""You are probably going to get fired and you are also going to leave a player and get a better job. ""Sometimes change is good; guys can just get flat. They might fire their caddie and say, 'We are still good buddies but I have to make a change to mix something up'."" Weir and Little worked together for 11 years until 2010 before Little took up a new challenge with Colombian Camilo Villegas. There were no hard feelings between Weir and Little, rather a mutual agreement to try something new. Little now works with American Gary Woodland, with the pair winning the 2019 US Open together. In golf, the caddie and player can both benefit from working with others. In 2023, Little spent time with England's Justin Rose in the run-up to the Open. ""It was interesting to see how he operates,"" says Little. ""It is totally different. It is good to see his routines - when you are with one guy you only see the same thing. ""I would even encourage it - if Gary had a buddy to play with him, I would be totally fine with it. ""It helps clear his head space. If you have a guy who relies on you too much as a caddie, he is not thinking for himself."" The one constant on the tour as a caddie is the community. Bits of local know-how about the course and its set-up are often shared. At last year's Masters, Brooks Koepka's caddie from Northern Ireland, Ricky Elliott, was cleared of revealing to Little, in contravention to golf's rules,, external what club Koepka had used for a shot. While caddies are not allowed to swap tips mid-round, they often walk the course together before competitions to discuss strategy. ""Sometimes it is good to just talk to guys and see what they think about a hole and whether or not I agree - it doesn't matter,"" says Little. ""It is good to get some different opinions."" Taneka Mackey is part of that caddie community. She carries Amy Olson's bag on the Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour (LPGA). Like Little, she fell into the role. Growing up in the Bahamas and making their national golf team, Mackey always had a passion for travelling. After a chance pairing to help Olson at an event in the Bahamas in 2017, she saw the possibility of a career that would take her round the world. ""Amy said, 'I still want you to caddie for me - can you come to Australia?' When I heard the word 'Australia' I knew I needed to get in shape and learn a few more things,"" Mackey says. Mackey (left) won a golf scholarship to Chicago State University having played the first six years of her career with a set of borrowed clubs Mackey has found herself at events and venues across the world where she is the only black woman on the bag. On one trip to Asia there were no black female players and only one black caddie. Mackey felt uncomfortable for ""half a second"" with thoughts of ""do I belong here?"" entering her head. ""I am here for a reason and I am going to be the person that makes the difference,"" she says. ""From then I have never looked back. I take everything in my stride, staying as positive as possible. There is so much negativity in this world that the last person I am going to beat down is myself. ""With female caddies, there aren't many - it is hard physically, some women might want kids, and you can't carry a bag and caddie forever."" In golf, consistency, longevity and commitment are core components of success. Mackey's turn of speed has also proved useful. A keen basketball player in her youth and the daughter of a talented hurdler, Mackey had to sprint back down the second fairway at one event after realising she had dropped her towel on the opening green. With each club requiring a dry-down after every shot, there was not a moment's hesitation. Olson tied for second at the 2020 US Open and Mackey is still hunting a first major title on the bag. The 29-year-old also has a different achievement in her sights. Her goal is to set up an elementary school in the Bahamas and inspire the next generation of young black girls. ""Golf-wise, I want to win, but if I never win as a caddie I am perfectly fine with that. It is just more showing kids and inspiring people, especially in the Bahamas, that you can do what you put your mind to,"" she says. ""I speak at schools here in the Bahamas in my off weeks just to show kids that you can grow up in a small country but do big things."" From the feeling of winning a major to inspiring a new generation - the ambitions of a caddie are as varied as the duties. It is much more than just carrying a set of clubs.

2,Uefa considering increasing Euro 2024 squad sizes,Uefa is considering increasing squad sizes for this summer's European Championships to 26 players following talks with coaches.," Last updated on 9 April 20249 April 2024.From the section Football Uefa is considering increasing squad sizes for this summer's European Championship in Germany to 26 players following talks with coaches. Discussions with international bosses whose teams had qualified for Euro 2024 were held in Dusseldorf on Monday. ""Uefa has taken note of the various opinions and points of view shared,"" said a statement from European football's governing body  ""A final decision will be made in the coming weeks."" The subject was discussed as part of a wider two-day workshop for finalists, and now goes to Uefa's national team competitions committee then its executive committee. Squads are currently limited to 23 players, a return to the regulations used prior to Euro 2020. For that tournament, three further players were allowed to mitigate against the impact of potential Covid outbreaks in the squad. Uefa's statement added: ""The positive discussions highlighted different points of view among coaches, with some expressing a desire to increase the squad size.  ""Others stated their preference to cap the squad size at 23, pointing out the difficulty in training with additional players, group management and the increased financial burdens placed upon national associations."" England boss Gareth Southgate was previously in favour of 23-man squads but recently spoke of a preference for three extra players to cope with a demanding end to a domestic season ""complicated"" by personnel returning from long-term injuries. England and Scotland have two friendlies at the start of June before the deadline to submit their final Euros squads to Uefa on 7 June. Euro 2024 begins on 14 June with Scotland taking on hosts Germany in the opening game in Munich, while England get under way against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen on 16 June. Thomas Tuchel says Bayern Munich were denied a penalty by a ""kid's mistake"", while one pundit describes Arsenal not being awarded a spot-kick as ""quite alarming"".

3,'I've never seen a player persecuted like Vinicius',"Vinicius Jr has overcome the odds to reach the top, but nothing could have prepared him for what he would face in Spain."," Last updated on 8 April 20248 April 2024.From the section European Football Brazil had just beaten England 1-0 last month when reporters approached Vinicius Jr for an interview at Wembley's mixed zone. ""But are we going to talk about football?"" the Real Madrid forward smilingly responded. After the positive answer, he agreed to take a few questions. Having already known that he would be doing a press conference in Madrid a couple of days later that would be mostly dominated by his personal fight against racism, Vinicius wanted to avoid the topic in London. And so he did. But then, when speaking before Brazil's friendly match versus Spain, he broke down in tears while discussing the toll the racist abuse he continues to suffer in Spanish stadiums has had on him. ""I just want to play football, but it's hard to move forward. I feel sadder and sadder and have less and less desire to play,"" he said. ""At 23 years old, I have to teach many Spaniards what racism is."" That a superstar for both the biggest club and national team in the world had reached the point of even considering his future at this stage of his career only highlighted how far the situation has developed. La Liga referred 10 racist incidents involving Vinicius to Spanish prosecutors last season, but little appears to have been done so far. When Real Madrid take on Manchester City on Tuesday in the Champions League quarter-finals, the number seven may not stand out as the most talented player on the Santiago Bernabeu pitch - although he comes into that conversation. But perhaps he is the most important footballer in the world at the moment. His fight goes way beyond football. Over recent years, Vinicius has become the leading black voice in challenging racism in football and, despite the emotional burden it has brought him, he has no intention of backing off. ""Vinicius is breaking the silence that used to surround this issue and was imposed by the football industry in the past,"" Marcelo Carvalho, founder and executive director of the Observatory of Racial Discrimination in Football, told BBC Sport. ""He's fighting against a system that is racist."" Having grown up in Sao Goncalo, the most dangerous city in Rio de Janeiro's metropolitan area, Vinicius had to overcome the odds to make it to the top. None of this, however, prepared him for what he would face in Spain after leaving Flamengo for Real Madrid aged 18 in 2018, with relentless abuse from the stands, monkey chants and an effigy hung from a bridge directed his way. ""I've looked back a bit and I've never seen a player who has been persecuted like Vinicius,"" Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti said last month. Such is the severity of the situation that it has turned into a diplomatic issue, with the Brazilian government summoning the Spanish ambassador to explain the incidents and calling for measures to stop them. While the feeling of impunity remains, Vinicius acts on his own. Last year, the forward launched a campaign under the slogan ""Racism, don't pretend you don't see it"" on billboards across his country and even abroad for Black Awareness Day.  He has also helped to renovate several schools back home through his foundation and released an anti-racism manual to make the educational environment more inclusive. He has been vocal on social media about racism cases involving other footballers as well. ""These initiatives are 100% his. What we do is [make them happen] and give him more strength to fight. We offer advice, but in the end it's his fight. He didn't start a war against racism out of nowhere. He suffered it,"" explained his agent Frederico Pena. ""He's combative. He always has been. It runs in the family."" Unhappy with the treatment he received from La Liga last season, Vinicius contemplated the idea of leaving Real Madrid, but it is now safe to say his relationship with the organisation has changed. There is an acknowledgement of recent efforts made by the league. Within his entourage, there was some concern regarding the impact of racist abuse on his performances but, despite the criticism towards his on-field behaviour, Vinicius could be on the way to his best season so far. With 18 goals and six assists for Los Blancos in this campaign, Vinicius is only behind Jude Bellingham in terms of numbers for the Spanish giants - the English midfielder has 20 goals and 10 assists. ""Obviously, the racism cases are affecting him in some way. We can see he's more reactive during games,"" Carvalho said of Vinicius. ""So while it's great to have someone as powerful as Vinicius involved in this fight, it's also dangerous for him to be in this position because of the pressure he can feel on the pitch and from other clubs and sponsors wanting to silence him."" He will be hoping to put all this aside versus City and, when the whistle blows, do what he does best: play football. Thomas Tuchel says Bayern Munich were denied a penalty by a ""kid's mistake"", while one pundit describes Arsenal not being awarded a spot-kick as ""quite alarming"".

4,IPL: India's pace sensation Mayank Yadav lights up tournament,"Mayank Yadav from Delhi has been described as a ""child of the wind"" by former West Indian pacer Ian Bishop.","Every year, the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world's richest cricket tournament, unveils rich talents. Only twice though has there been awed chatter about a young Indian pace bowler because of their exceptional speed. Umran Malik from Indian-administered Kashmir created a storm three years ago. In IPL 2024, it's Mayank Yadav who is turning heads almost as quickly as he's turning up the dial on speed guns.  The 21-year-old lanky bowler from Delhi made his IPL debut for Lucknow Super Giants against Punjab Kings in March and set pulses racing with a terrific spell of fast bowling. He bowled a delivery at 155.8 km/h (96 mph) and won the man-of-the-match award on debut. In the next game Yadav went one better with a 156.7 km/h (96 mph) scorcher - the season's quickest delivery so far - and a second successive man-of-the-match award against Royal Challengers Bangalore, an IPL first for a debutant. He picked up six wickets for 41 runs across the two matches. Yadav's performance prompted Ian Bishop, commentator and former West Indies bowler, to describe him as a ""child of the wind"".  Dale Steyn, one of the greatest fast bowlers in history, and who Yadav described as his only idol, said on Twitter: ""Mayank Yadav where have you been hiding!"" In a tweet after his second game, Steyn simply wrote: ""That's a serious ball! #PACE"". Former Australia player Tom Moody felt Yadav was ""definitely in the conversation"" to make India's squad for the T20 World Cup that will follow the IPL.  What prompted the normally measured and seasoned experts to gush about Yadav after he had played only two matches?  For one, pace. Others have also topped 150 km/h in this IPL, but none as consistently as Yadav, or with quite the same ferocious effect.  But pace alone is seldom enough at the top level. What made Yadav stand out was his control. He hasn't yet bowled a single extra in the IPL. He has varied his lengths without pace being affected. And then there's the quality of batters snared, and the manner of their dismissals. Against Punjab he accounted for Jonny Bairstow, one of the more accomplished players of fast bowling, by hurrying him on the pull shot, a sure-fire indicator of how quick he was.  He went even better against Bangalore, similarly dismissing Glenn Maxwell, one of the best T20 bats in the world.  He then beat another Australian star, Cameron Green, for sheer pace when uprooting his off-stump. Green is no stranger to fast bowling. Here, he stood frozen at the crease, bat hanging loosely, a tell tale sign of a batter anticipating a short delivery and belatedly reacting to one that wasn't. ""He has some real extra speed that you don't really see a lot of around world cricket at the moment,"" Maxwell told ESPN, comparing Yadav to ex-Australia bowler Shaun Tait at his peak. Fast bowlers commonly accept that the faster they bowl, the harder it becomes to maintain control. Tait and Malik have both faced that. So far, Yadav has defied the stereotype.  Other potential pitfalls await though.  Several Indian pacers have arrived on the scene as tearaway quicks, only to settle into the ""medium-fast"" category as the years go by.  Then there's the constant risk of injury that comes with repeatedly executing the physically demanding action of fast bowling over extended periods. After his first two games, Yadav encountered the looming threat of injury in his third match against Gujarat Titans. He bowled just one over, hitting around 140 km/h, fast for most bowlers but below Yadav's usual standard. Then he left the field with a side strain. Team-mates said that Yadav seemed fine and there wasn't much cause to worry. Even if he recovers quickly, this incident offers insight into the pressures of fast bowling and its impact on speed. Yadav has already contended with the issue - he missed the IPL last year due to injury. Yadav's journey started when his father, a police vehicle siren seller, enrolled him at Delhi's renowned Sonnet Cricket Club. His pace caught the attention of former India cricketer Vijay Dahiya, then coaching Uttar Pradesh, during a net session at a domestic tournament. Dahiya, who was also assistant coach with LSG, called up Gautam Gambhir, then the LSG team mentor, and said Yadav had to be signed. LSG bought Yadav for his base price of two million rupees in the IPL 2022 auction, but they didn't play him the first year because he didn't have enough ""bowling miles"" in his legs. But they never doubted his ability. It's still early days for Yadav. Many pitfalls have to be navigated.  The case of Malik is a reminder of how difficult the journey is. Malik played 10 ODIs and 8 T20Is for India in 2022 and 2023, but cannot currently command a guaranteed place in the first XI of his franchise, Sunrisers Hyderabad.  But if Yadav can stay fit, and continue to grow as a bowler, life will happen for him at 150km/h too. Can US pressure deliver Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza?

5,Williamson to start for England against Republic of Ireland,Leah Williamson will make her first England appearance in a year in Tuesday's Euro 2025 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland.," Last updated on 8 April 20248 April 2024.From the section Women's Football Captain Leah Williamson will make her first England appearance in a year in Tuesday's Euro 2025 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland, manager Sarina Wiegman confirmed. Williamson suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in April 2023 and missed the Women's World Cup. She was an unused substitute in Friday's 1-1 draw with Sweden.  ""It will be emotional,"" said Williamson, who captained England to the Euro 2022 title. She added: ""I'm an emotional person. We've all seen me cry on many occasions. It was emotional on Friday because if there's a team you want to be in, in the world, England would be right up there. I love playing for England.""  All 23 players trained at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on Monday, including Williamson, whose last England game was a 2-0 defeat by Australia in April 2023. She had to sit in the stands as England lost the World Cup final to Spain in August and was ruled out of February's friendly internationals with a hamstring injury.  ""I think who I am on the pitch is exactly who I was off the pitch. I don't think I was a calming presence for anyone especially,"" said Williamson.  ""But I've enjoyed watching the girls and being a part of that journey in a different way. Obviously, I've got people that play for the team that are very important to me but it's been a difficult journey. ""I'd be lying if I said this wasn't what I had my focus on - this is where I was trying to get back to. I wanted to get back into this squad because I've had some of the best memories of my life as part of this team. ""Being at the World Cup final and sitting next to Jill Scott was one of the worst decisions I have ever made, in my entire life! I just live and breathe it. I love playing for England and I love watching England."" Williamson was on the bench as England kickstarted their Euro 2025 qualifying campaign with a disappointing 1-1 draw with Sweden on Friday but Wiegman says she had ""hard choices"" to make in her selections for Tuesday's game in Dublin. ""Of course Leah is a fantastic player. I want to say first that we had hard choices to make in the team. The competitiveness is really high. We have many options in different positions,"" said Wiegman. ""What Leah brings is of course vision and in possession she is very bright. She finds the right pass. The flexibility in defence, she is able to defend the space behind her together with everyone else.  ""Defending does not start with one player but with the whole team. That's what I hope Leah will bring to the team tomorrow."" England face Sweden, France and the Republic of Ireland, ranked 25th in the world, in their qualifying group. The top two teams automatically secure a spot at next summer's tournament in Switzerland. The other two sides drop into the play-offs. Tuesday's opponents the Republic of Ireland are the lowest-ranked side in the group but Wiegman would not be drawn into describing it as a ""must-win"" game. ""Well I don't really want to talk about must-win - but we really want to win this game. If we win this game it puts us in a better position,"" said Wiegman.  ""We know this group. It's hard to predict where it will go. You just go out there in every game and try to play your best game. That's what we will do [on Tuesday].  ""Yes, we know, if the result is good, it puts us in a better position. If the result is not good, it puts us in a harder position. But there are still four other opportunities to change that around."" Williamson could come up against Republic of Ireland captain and Arsenal team-mate Katie McCabe, and has a very simple plan to deal with her. ""Err, well if she doesn't have the ball then she can't do anything. That's a good start, right?"" joked Williamson. ""I think Katie is a big personality. She's always been somebody that is very proud of where she comes from and has been authentic in that with the fans so I think a lot of people connect to her in that way.  ""She knows her strengths; she has those strengths that can be game-changing as well, which I think has raised the profile of her game and, subsequently, Arsenal's. So she's been an important player for us over the last couple of years."" What is the media's role in amplifying the internet's wildest speculation?

7,LIV golfer Joaquin Niemann wants unified rankings as he prepares for 2024 Masters,"LIV golfer Joaquin Niemann says the breakaway tour must be recognised in the official world rankings as the current system is ""a lie"".","Joaquin Niemann is one of the top 10 golfers in the world at the moment, according to 2017 Masters winner Sergio Garcia The 88th Masters Venue: Augusta National Dates: 11-14 April Coverage: Live radio and text commentary on BBC Sounds and BBC Sport website of each round. Full details LIV golfer Joaquin Niemann says the breakaway tour needs to be recognised in the official world rankings because the current system can be ""a lie"". With LIV events not given ranking points, Chile's Niemann is 91st in the world yet among the favourites to win the Masters at Augusta on Sunday. He won two of LIV's first three events in 2024, continuing his form having won the Australian Open in December. ""Right now the game is divided and it is not helping,"" Niemann said. ""It is hard to get a ranking system where everyone is happy."" Niemann, 25, has been given a special invitation to play at the Masters, which begins at Augusta National on Thursday and concludes on Sunday. Everything you need to know about the 2024 Masters LIV switch could be golf's tipping point - Rahm Bhatia wins Texas Open play-off to secure Masters spot The Saudi-backed LIV league has been denied accreditation by the Official World Golf Ranking, with LIV commissioner Greg Norman telling its players last month the application to join had been withdrawn. Many of the big names which left the PGA Tour have slipped down the rankings, with Jon Rahm, Tyrrell Hatton and Brooks Koepka being the only LIV players to feature in the OWGR's top 50. ""I feel [a unified system] is something which has to happen and will happen over time,"" Niemann told BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter at the recent LIV event in Miami.  ""It could be sooner or later, I don't know. Hopefully it will happen soon. I feel like the world ranking is a lie for a few players."" As well as his success in the LIV events, Niemann has earned top-five finishes in the past four tournaments he has played on the DP World Tour and the Asian Tour. LIV players are only able to improve their world ranking, which is one of the factors used to determine eligibility for major championships, through DP World Tour events, the Asian Tour or other satellite tours. Niemann played two ranking events in Australia before travelling to tournaments in Dubai and Oman, and his form prompted Masters organisers to reward him with an invitation. Spain's Sergio Garcia, who defected to LIV in 2022, says the decision showed golf's major tournaments ""know what they are doing"".  ""They can see what is going on and know Joaquin, for example, is not the 91st player in the world,"" Garcia, who won his sole major at Augusta in 2017, told BBC Sport. ""They know he is probably top 10, or top 15 at worst, and that is why he gets an invite to play at the Masters.  ""The majors are realising all those things and doing whatever they think is the best for them to have the best players possible competing in their events.""

8,Brook century helps Yorks earn draw with Leics,England's Harry Brook hits century to help Yorkshire draw with Leicestershire in County Championship.," Last updated on 8 April 20248 April 2024.From the section Countiescomments264 England's Harry Brook hit a stunning final-day 100 not out as Yorkshire and Leicestershire had to settle for an opening-round County Championship draw at Headingley. Coach Ottis Gibson also confirmed that former England captain Joe Root will join Brook in Yorkshire's line-up on Friday against Gloucestershire at Bristol. Brook arrived at the crease four balls into day four of this weather-ravaged Division Two fixture, after overnight rain and a wet outfield once again delayed the start of play. Yorkshire had started on 72-2 in their reply to Leicestershire's 354. But George Hill fell caught off a miscue in the day's opening over, paving the way for Brook to come in and entertain the hardy 178 spectators who had waited patiently for play. Brook, 25, had not batted in a competitive fixture since playing for England in December. The death of his grandmother led to him pulling out of the Test series in India at the start of the year and opting not to play in the ongoing IPL. However, in the first of five Championship matches he has made himself available for, he smashed 14 fours and two sixes in 69 balls, with Yorkshire declaring immediately on 264-6 just before tea in order to improve a slow-over rate from the first innings. They did this successfully as spinners Dan Moriarty and Adam Lyth raced through 7.2 overs before the rain arrived at 4pm with Leicestershire on 26-0 in their second innings. Yorkshire coach Ottis Gibson: ""Harry Brook makes it look so easy. Having him in our batting line-up makes a huge difference. ""Quite often, we're asking our youngsters who their role-models are. Importantly, we have a role-model in our dressing room. That's a real positive. We are the benefactors of that, and we are very grateful to have him. We'll enjoy watching him bat for the next four games if he carries on batting the way he is.  ""Adam Lyth had a fantastic winter at the ripe old age of 36, so it was good to see him get a hundred and also be the standard bearer for the youngsters.""  Leicestershire captain Lewis Hill: ""There's a lot of talk about Yorkshire being promotion favourites, so to come here and get 13 points is a good return. ""They've got some high-quality batters, especially Harry Brook. He struck it very well. ""Everybody got in for us, which is fantastic. On the flipside of that, when you get in you've got to go on.""

9,Real Madrid will want revenge - Guardiola,Pep Guardiola believes Real Madrid will be determined to get revenge after Manchester City thrashed the Spanish giants in last season's Champions League.," Last updated on 9 April 20249 April 2024.From the section European Footballcomments747 Holders Manchester City and Real Madrid shared six goals in a thriller to leave their Champions League quarter-final evenly poised after the first leg at the Bernabeu.  Pep Guardiola's side took the lead in the second minute when Bernardo Silva cleverly snuck a 25-yard free-kick round the wall past goalkeeper Andriy Lunin.  Two deflected strikes brought 14-time European Cup winners Madrid level. First Eduardo Camavinga's long-range effort hit Ruben Dias and spun into the far corner of Stefan Ortega's goal, before Rodrygo got in behind the City defence and poked home via Manuel Akanji's heel.  City were dominant in possession throughout under the closed roof of the Bernabeu but lacked quality in the final third - until Phil Foden stepped up.  The England midfielder had been on the periphery of the game but found space just outside the area to turn and fire into the top corner to pull City level.  Moments later left-back Josko Gvardiol cut in and found the far corner with a superb right-foot shot to score his first goal since joining City from RB Leipzig in the summer.  However, Madrid equalised with a stunning volley from Federico Valverde to set up an intriguing second leg on Wednesday, 17 April at Etihad Stadium, where City beat Madrid 4-0 in last season's semi-finals. There was late concern for City though, with Foden hobbling after a late tackle on his ankle.  Foden allayed fears of a serious injury, telling TNT Sports he had a ""bad dead leg"" and was hopeful of being fit for Saturday's Premier League home game against Luton.  Manchester City, who won this competition for the first time last season as part of a historic Treble, came into this game with Kevin de Bruyne on the bench after the Belgium midfielder was ill on Tuesday.  They got the perfect start when Silva cleverly curled in the opener after Aurelien Tchouameni, who will now miss the second leg, fouled Jack Grealish.  Guardiola's team were rocked by Madrid's quickfire response, but showed patience in their build-up with Madrid happy to sit off the Premier League champions, only pressing when City got near the penalty area.  It worked for large parts of the game and opened up counter-attacking opportunities for Carlo Ancelotti's side, but City's quality eventually told. Foden had been quiet, drifting between wide right and attacking midfield, but his superb season continued when he smartly turned and fired an unstoppable drive into the top-right corner of the goal. When Gvardiol put the visitors ahead, just a second win at the Bernabeu looked on for City, before they were pegged back by Valverde's wonderful low drive.  However, City now have the chance at home to progress to the semi-finals for the fourth consecutive season, where in recent years they have blown sides away in the Champions League.  This is a very different Real Madrid team to the all-conquering sides which dominated the tournament this century. Their general shape, often with 11 men behind the ball, showed City a lot of respect, and perhaps vulnerability on the back of last season's chastening defeat in Manchester. However, their solid defensive shape allowed them to exploit one of the few weaknesses City have. At the back Guardiola's side lack pace, especially with the continued absence of Kyle Walker, and that allowed Rodrygo to get in down the City right for the second Madrid goal. It was a weakness that Madrid, who are top of La Liga and had nine days off coming into the game, continued to target but Vinicius Junior, Jude Bellingham and Rodrygo all saw efforts saved or go wide.  It is a tactic they are likely to use at the Etihad in eight days' time, but last season Ancelotti's side struggled to gain possession in the second leg against a fired-up City, so opportunities may be few and far between. It will be fascinating to see if Guardiola's team, who are one point off top spot in the Premier League and into the FA Cup semi-finals, can do it again and continue their march towards another Treble.
